# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description 
 The aim of this project is to create a web-based calendar application that allows a user to schedule their work day by saving events or adding a to do list for each hour of the day in order to manage their time effectively. 

 The web-base calendar application will function as follows;
 * Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the calendar planner.
 * Allow user to write events in the specified timeblock when clicked.
 * User will be able to store their event when the save button is clicked for the specific timeblock.
 * User entry will be populated when the user write their descriptive event or to do list in their desired timeblock.
 * Each timeblock is color-coded based on past, present and future when the time block are clicked and viewed.
 * Past timeblock is color-coded as GREY, present timeblock is color-coded as RED while the future timeblock is color-coded as GREEN
