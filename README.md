# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description 
 The aim of this project is to create a web-based calendar application that allows a user to save events or to do list for each hour of the day in order to manage time effectively.

 The web-base calendar application will function as follows;
 * Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the calendar planner.
 * Allow user to write in the event time block when clicked.
 * User will be able to store their event when a save button is click for the specific timeblock.
 * User entry will be populated when user write a their descriptive event or to do list. 
 * Each timeblock is color-coded based on past, present and future when the time block are clicked and viewed.
